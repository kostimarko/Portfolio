			<h1>The Beginning</h1>
			<p>
				We started where our country started, The Constitution. What made is so special, that made people who had never seen the America dream of it? The beauty of freedom from a ruler, The Consitution and Bill of Rights is the America dream.

			<h1>The Research</h1>
			<p>
				We looked further into public institutions, we looked at what made places like public libraries, bookmobiles and other knowledge sharing devices we have used in American history. To learn what made other Presidential Libraries work we had to pick up our cell phones and call them one by one. I spoke to a Ms. Naguib from The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, She was humbled that I wanted to talk to her. She told me all the ways the library helps the community around The Library. I did further research on Jimmy Carter, I realized that the morals and values Jimmy Carter stood for were being expressed in the same way in his presidential library.

We pinned paper to the wall and just started filling in our information, from attendance records to what they served for lunch. We didn't know what information was important to our story, but we did know that we had to put the due diligence into uncovering the raw data.

			<h1>The Trip</h1>
			<p>
				With our semester coming to an end, we knew that to get the full experience; we had to go to a presidential library. We chose the last democratic president, Bill Clinton. When we got their we realized how much of an impact The Library really brought to the community around it. The Library brought business, it brought a new life to that part of Little Rock, Arkansas.

			<h1>The Process</h1>
			<p>
				We saw the mountain we had to ascend, we broke into smaller teams to carry all of the weight. We came together and realized that this identity needed to be cohesive, it needed to move forward with time, as with the future we were unsure of what potential The Barack Obama Presidential Library could bring. We could not design just an identity, we designed a system of thinking about The Library. We designed multiple moving parts to attribute to the way the future of The Library would go. I was a part of Team Twist, who was deemed such for our gravitation towards concentric circles and moving typography, whose basis relied in the spread of knowledge.

		<section class="intro">
			<h1>The Final Concept</h1>
			<p>
				A waterdrop lands on the surface of a pond. This is not its destination but rather the origination of something greater: energy emanating outward in shallow waves of ever-larger concentric circles. The pond stirs and is altered by virtue of a single drop. This is the idea behind this swirl-like type variation. The energy radiates outward from its foundational centerpoint, just as the dynamism and promise of change instigated by the Obama Library will radiate ever outward, from one community to the next.

			<h1>The End</h1>
			<p>
				We ended our year with a final book of what our concept of an identity system for The Barack Obama Presidential Library could be. We pushed for a presentation with the Executive Director of The Barack Obama Foundation. This is our final picture and our book is in Barack Obama's hands.
